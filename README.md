#DeadlockSSH: The Goofiest SSH Honeypot on the Block

Ever wondered what script kiddies and bots are up to? Do you have a burning desire to watch them fumble around in a digital sandbox you control? Well, my friend, you've stumbled upon the perfect project!

**DeadlockSSH** is the digital equivalent of a venus flytrap for nosy hackers. It looks like a real SSH server, it smells like a real SSH server, but it's actually a cleverly disguised trap that will log their every move while leaving them stuck in connection limbo. It's like a roach motel for the internet's uninvited guests: they check in, but they don't check out (or get a shell).

## What's in the Box? (aka Features)

This isn't your grandma's honeypot. We've packed it with all sorts of goodies:

-   **Port Flexibility:** Run it on the classic port 22, or go wild and pick 2222, 22222, or even 8008! The world is your oyster.
-   **Juggles Connections:** Thanks to the magic of multi-threading, it can handle a whole crowd of unwanted visitors at once.
-   **Slow-Mo Banner:** We send the SSH banner one... character... at... a... time. Why? Because it's hilarious and it mimics some real-world servers. Patience is a virtue, attackers!
-   **The Annoyance-O-Meter™:** The more an IP address connects, the longer they have to wait. It's our special way of saying, "Maybe find a new hobby?"
-   **Super-Sleuth Logging:** We write down *everything*. Timestamps, IPs, what they tried to send us... it's all going in the logbook. We'll even rotate the logs so your hard drive doesn't cry for mercy.
-   **Pulls a Houdini:** Shuts down gracefully with a simple `Ctrl+C`. No mess, no fuss.
-   **Bonus! HTTP Stats Party:** Flip a switch, and you get a little web server showing off your honeypot's stats. See who's been knocking on your door the most!

## Getting Your Hands Dirty (Installation)

Guess what? You probably already have everything you need. If you've got Python 3.6+ installed, you're golden. No crazy dependencies, no weird installations.

```bash
# Just clone or download the files. That's it. Seriously.
git clone https://github.com/S1B34/DeadlockSSH
cd DeadlockSSH  
```

## Let's Light This Candle! (Quick Start)

Ready to start catching some flies?

```bash
# Fire it up with the default settings (it'll listen on port 2222)
python3 deadlockssh.py

# Feeling brave? Run it on the actual SSH port (you'll need sudo for this!)
# Warning: Make sure your real SSH server isn't on this port!
sudo python3 deadlockssh.py -p 22

# Want to use your own custom settings? Easy peasy.
python3 deadlockssh.py -c config.ini
```

We've even included a `config.ini` file for you to tinker with. Go on, don't be shy!

## The Nitty-Gritty (Configuration)

You can tweak almost everything in the `config.ini` file. Here's the cheat sheet:

| Option              | What it Does                                      | My Goofy Advice                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `port`              | The TCP port to listen on.                        | Pick a weird one to confuse people.                   |
| `max_connections`   | How many connections it can juggle at once.       | Set it high and watch the world burn (or just connect). |
| `ssh_banner`        | The fake SSH banner it shows.                     | Make it say something funny like "All your base are belong to us". |
| `banner_delay`      | How slow the banner appears.                      | Crank it up for maximum annoyance.                    |
| `initial_delay`     | The starting wait time for new visitors.          | A little patience-building exercise.                  |
| `delay_increment`   | How much extra waiting time for repeat offenders. | "You get a second, and YOU get a second!"             |
| `max_delay`         | The absolute longest they'll have to wait.        | Even we have our limits. 60 seconds is an eternity.   |
| `log_file`          | Where the juicy logs are stored.                  | Name it `totally_not_secret_stuff.log`.               |
| `enable_http_stats` | Turn on the stats web page.                       | Do it! It's like a scoreboard for your honeypot.      |
| `http_stats_port`   | The port for the stats page.                      | 8080 is a classic.                                    |

## The Hall of Shame (HTTP Stats)

If you enabled the stats server, you can peek at who's been visiting. Just open your browser or use `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/stats
```

You'll get a lovely JSON trophy showing your total connections, who's active, and a leaderboard of your most persistent "fans".

## A Word from Our Lawyers (Just Kidding, It's Me)

-   **Play Nice:** Only run this on networks you own. Don't be a jerk.
-   **Check Local Laws:** Make sure you're not breaking any rules. Boring, but important.
-   **Privacy, Shmivacy?** You're logging IPs. Be aware of that. This is for defense, not for snooping on your neighbor's cat videos.

## Pimp My Honeypot (Contributing)
